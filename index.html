            <p>Let's start with when I was born. First off everyone told my mom to get an abortion because
                I was an accident then even more when they found out I was a triplet. I am so grateful that 
                I am alive today and even more that I get to have now four siblings to live my life with me. My sister was
                told that she was basically dead when she was born and I came out blue and needed a tube stuck in me for a year.
                Both of us made it out and are so happy :) I've had an amzing life since then with a lot of crazy stories </p>
    <p>         I went to a private all girls High School that ended up closing down my senior year. It was a joke of a school and
                the amount of hilarious stories I have from this school will make your stomach hurt. We were best friends with our 
                teachers and even better friends with are whole class. It was a class of 37 students so everyone knew everyone and 
                everyone was equal, there was no such thing as popularity, just all being our goofy selves.

                My crazy friends and I all went to MSU and have had some CRAZY adventures. The amount of crazy college stories I've 
                had is unbelievable it will be life these blogs are fiction. With all the crazy stories there are a lot of life leasons
                I learned that I know you will benifit from. All these blogs will help you learn from my mistakes and teach you how great it
                is to have a good time when all you do is be yourself.
